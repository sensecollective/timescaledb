# TimescaleDB Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2017-06-28)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
Starting with this release, TimescaleDB will now
support upgrading between extension versions using the typical
`ALTER EXTENSION` command, unless otherwise noted in future release notes. This
important step should make it easier to test TimescaleDB and be able
to get the latest benefits from new versions of TimescaleDB. If you
were previously using a version with the `-beta` tag, you will need
to `DROP` any databases currently using TimescaleDB and re-create them
in order to upgrade to this new version. To backup and migrate data,
use `pg_dump` to save the table schemas and `COPY` to write hypertable
data to CSV for re-importing after upgrading is complete. We describe
a similar process on [our docs](http://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/setup/migrate-from-postgresql#different-db).

## 0.0.12-beta (2017-06-21)

**High-level changes**
* A major cleanup and refactoring was done to remove legacy code and
currently unused code paths. This change is **backwards incompatible**
and will require a database to be re-initialized and data re-imported.
This refactoring will allow us to provide upgrade paths starting with
the next release.
* `COPY` and `INSERT` commands now return the correct number of rows
* Default indexes no longer duplicate existing indexes
* Cleanup of the Docker image and build process
* Chunks are now time-aligned across partitions

**Notable commits**
* [3192c8a] Remove Dockerfile and docker.mk
* [2a01ebc] Ensure that chunks are aligned.
* [73622bf] Fix default index creation duplication of indexes
* [c8872fe] Fix command-tag for COPY and INSERT
* [bfe58b6] Refactor towards supporting version upgrades
* [db01c84] Make time-bucket function parallel safe
* [18db11c] Fix timestamp test
* [97bbb59] Make constraint exclusion work with non-text partition keys
* [f2b42eb] Fix problems with partitioning logic for padded fields
* [997029a] if_not_exist flag to create_hypertable now works on hypertables with data as well
* [347a8bd] Reference the correct column when scanning partition epochs
* [88a9849] Fix bug with timescaledb.allow_install_without_preload GUC not working
